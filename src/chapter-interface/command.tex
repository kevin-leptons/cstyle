\begin{crules}
    \cmust{Provide only executale file name same as package name}
    \cmust{Provide at most one dynamic library name follow}
    \verb/<package-name>[a-z0-9-_.]{16}/
    \cmust{Doesn't provide static library}
    \cmust{Provide command \path{version}}
    \cmust{Provice command \path{help}}
\end{crules}

Why provide only executale file with same name as package?.
Because it is easy for users when they installed package then they imediatly
call it from command line.

Why provide at most one dynamic library with same name of package?.
Because that library isn't created for other program, it only serve executale
in package. And one library serve for on executable is clear.

Why doesn't provide static library?. Because if executable code is small,
no need dynamic library, every thing putted in executable file.
If executable code is large enough, dynamic library may give efficient
memory. And that library isn't created for other program.

Why provide \path{version} command?. For checking of command version.
Why provide \path{help} command?. To help user get short program's manual.

Implementation of program is define by programmers.
