    \cmust{Use English for every things in ".h" and ".c" files}
\end{crules}

With private name strings, replace them by English pronunciations.
For examples below:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
            Private name & Replacement \\
            \hline
            "Bùi Tuấn Anh" & "Bui Tuan Anh" \\
            "長城" & "The Great Wall" \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

With strings which use to communicate with users, replace them by function
calls to get it. And of course, that functions must read data from resouce
files, doesn't use non English languages in other ".h" or ".c" files.
For examples below:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
            Communication string & Function call \\
            \hline
            "Nhập một số" & trans("type-a-number", "vi") \\
            "鍵入一個數字" & trans("type-a-number", "ch") \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Why only English is permited in ".h" and ".c" files ?. Because almost
programmers has English experience but they aren't certain with other
languages. So programmers has able and are comfort when they read
programs which written in English.

If your English isn't good enough, let learn it. It take few of months
depends on your English experience now, but after that, every things
become awesome with you in many ways. You have able to write English,
other programmers like that. And you have able to read programs of other
programmers, you like that. Every one are happy.

Language usage isn't problem of only \clang{}, it is problem of any programming
languages. Almost coding standards of other programming languages has
opinion same as \pkgname{}.
