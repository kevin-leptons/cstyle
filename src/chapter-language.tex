\chapter{Language}

English use to

\begin{itemize}
\item
Name files
\item
Write comments
\item
Write source code
\end{itemize}

All of languages was supported by UTF-8 use to communication with
\mbox{end-user}.

Note that this wonâ€™t work inside complex environments, like math for example.
You may be wondering, why should I load a package called verbatim to have the
possibility to add comments? The answer is straightforward: commented text is
interpreted by the compiler just like verbatim text, the only difference is
that verbatim text is introduced within the document, while the comment is just
dropped.
