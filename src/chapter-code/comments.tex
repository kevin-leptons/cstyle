\section{Comments}

\begin{crules}
    \cmust{Provide description comments at top}
    \cmust{Reduce comments in \mbox{non-description} parts}
    \cmust{Use \mbox{one-line} comment for \mbox{non-description} parts}
    \cnot{Use multiline comments in \mbox{non-description} parts}
\end{crules}

Why reduce comments in \mbox{none-description} parts?. Comments help code
become clearly?. It's not. When enter \mbox{non-description} parts, programmers
reads code, not comments. So, code must be clear, not more comments. In other
way, reduce comments in \mbox{non-description} parts increase code density.
It help reduces next page actions.

Why only use \mbox{one-line}?. For easy to write and same as priciple above:
Reduce comments in \mbox{non-description} parts.
