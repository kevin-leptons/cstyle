aying that latex thinks the end of document is best is misleading. It goes to the end of the document as [h] prevents the float being placed at the top of any page [t] or on a float page [p] so most of the time it won;t fit "here" (because that point is too far down the page) so the float can not be placed anywhere so is dumped at the end as emergency error recovery
