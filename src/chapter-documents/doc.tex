\section{doc directory}

\begin{crules}
    \cmust{Put entry of development documents in "doc/dev.md"}
    \cmust{Put entry of usage documents in "doc/usage.md"}
    \cmust{Build development documents then put result in "dest/doc/dev"}
    \cmust{Build usage documents then put result in "dest/doc/usage"}
\end{crules}

"doc" directory look like below:\\
\dirtree{%
.1 doc/.
.2 dev.md.
.2 usage.md.
.2 ....
}

\pkgname{} doesn't specify "How structure documents", it just specify entry
of two type of documents are \mbox{dev-doc} and \mbox{usage-doc}. So
programmers and users easy to find documents.

Programmers can usage any markdown compliers to build documents's source code
into various formats such as pdf, plain text or html.
